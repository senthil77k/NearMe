    Thiruvarur New Bus Stand is a modern and spacious bus terminal that was inaugurated by the
     chief minister of Tamil Nadu in February 2019. It is located about 2 km away from the old bus stand 
     and the railway junction. It has 35 bus bays divided into three platforms, each serving different
    destinations. The bus stand is well connected by TNSTC and SETC buses, as well as cabs and autos. 
    It also has various facilities for the convenience of the passengers, such as booking counters,
    information centre, police cabin, pharmacy, feeding room, restrooms, and parking. The bus stand also
    has many stalls and hotels that offer food, snacks, water, and other essentials at reasonable prices.
     The bus stand is a major hub for the Cauvery Delta region, as it connects Thiruvarur with many 
     important cities and towns, such as Chennai, Trichy, Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Nagapattinam, Velankanni,
      Salem, Coimbatore, Madurai, and Kanyakumari. Thiruvarur New Bus Stand is a symbol of the development
       and progress of the district, and a boon for the travellers and commuters
